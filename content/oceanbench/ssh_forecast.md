**Why Reanalysis?** 
Reanalysis produces a comprehensive . 
It uses the outputs of a numerical GCM that simulates the evolution of the ocean state combined with observations to generate a synthesized estimate of the ocean state. 
For a forecasting problem, one approach is to train a model based on reanalysis data because it is the .
Another approach is to train a model based on model data. 
However, we can postulate that the rea


**GLORYS Product**.  
The GLORYS product has the temperature, salinity, current speed, current direction, sea-level, sea-ice extent, sea-ice concentration, and sea-ice thickness.


In this case, will use the GLORYS
