# State Representation + Architecture

* Encoding:
    * Regularity, e.g. RK4
    * Symmetries, e.g. equivariant, invariant
    * Conservation Laws, e.g. conservation of mass, energy, rotational invariance
* Operator Learning
* Universal Differential Equations
    * incorporating NN into traditional PDE solvers
