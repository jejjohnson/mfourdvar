In this chapter we will explore some key decisions we need to consider when deciding which model representation we are going to employ. Below is a whirlwind tour of what's to come.

**Dynamical Systems**. 
The make-up of a dynamical system is the basis of most processes in geosciences.
Here, we give an overview of a.

**Known, Unknown, Hybrid**.
Our knowledge is always limited.
However, we can always make some assumptions about which assumptions we would like to assume based on the architectures

**Continuous Fields**.
Admittedly, many continuous systems are limited to solutions which have an analytical form. 
However, we also introduce *neural fields* as a neural network representation of a continuous field that can be learned from observations.

**Discrete Fields**.
Continuous representations are expensive so most times we end up with discrete representations of our systems.


**Mesh Fields (TODO)**.
